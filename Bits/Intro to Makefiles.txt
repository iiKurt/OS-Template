A makefile works upon the principle that files only need recreating if their dependencies are newer than the file being created/recreated (target).

TARGET: DEPENDENCIES
	command

####################
Example
####################

EFIHDD: EFI
	command

EFI: OBJECT
	command

OBJECT: SOURCE
	command


Makefile runs through all of the rules:
It detects that the source is newer than the objects, runs command...
object is newer than EFI, runs command
EFI is newer than EFIHDD, runs command
:)
